# About COVID-19 Project

This is a simple program, aggregating specified data from COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths by country. Country and dates are chosen by user through input.

## How to work it

User is prompted to specify the Alpha2 country code to attain data on.
    Refer to "geoId.txt‚Äù file for list of country names and alpha-2 codes. This file contains a list of 249 countries the user can choose from. See examples below for user input.

### Data Source

When the "507_Covid_Project.py" is ran data from the European Centre for Disease PRevention and Control (ECDC) site is created into a JSON file on the user's current directory. The user is promted for once data is pulled form the site. The file is created each time the program is ran, updating daily data. The file created is name "dailyCovid19Data.json".
