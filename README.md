# About COVID-19 Project

This is a simple program, aggregating specified data from COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths by country. Country and dates are chosen by user through input.

## How to work it

User is prompted to specify the Alpha2 country code to attain data on.
    See "Country_Alpha2.txt‚Äù file for list of country names and alpha-2 codes.
    For example, to request US data, user input is "US".

### Data Source

When the "507_Covid_Project.py" is ran, before user input interaction the data will be downloaded as a JSON file in the user's current directory as a file named "dailyCovid19Data.json"

**European Centre for Diease Prevention and Control (ECDC)** - *Main Site* - [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en)

**ECDC Daily Data on COVID-19 Cases ** - *Data Site* - [ECDC](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/json)
